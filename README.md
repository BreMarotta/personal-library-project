# An Online Personal Libray

## The Back Story

For each project, I try to come up with a product that I would use in my daily life. Outside of learning to code, one of my main hobbies is reading. Therefore, I have a rather extensive library (both physical and digital). I thought it would be interestinng to create an online personal library where a user could catalog their books. 

### Features
The user can:
* Signup, Login, and Logout. Each user's data is password protected using bcrypt.

#### User Library:

* See an index of all books in the their library.
* Use the search bar to filter the library by author or title.
* Add a new book to their library. (This will be reflected on the library page and the addition will persist to the backend).

#### Each Book's Showpage:

* View a showpage for each book. This page will show all relevent details for the book.
* Update book details. (These updates will display on the frontend and persist to the backend).
* Add/delete quotes.
* Delete books from the library.

#### Genres:

* Can use genre links in the navigation bar to view a filtered library of their books. This index will show only books in that genre. These links are only generated for genres in which the user has books.
* Can use a dropdown menu of all genres listed in the backend when adding a new book.
* Can add additional genres to the backend. These additional genres can be utilized by all users.
